I am part of the Technology Development team @ C3G/McGill University.   
We develop open source tools for the genomics community, analyze data for large consortia and train academics in bioinformatics.  
Check out some of our tools on [our website](http://www.computationalgenomics.ca/) or on our [bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/mugqic/projects/PROJ).  


My current research revolves around understanding the human cell in health and disease. I look at various genomics data, such as gene expression, DNA binding and DNA folding, to understand cellular differentiation and disease.  
Check out some of my manuscripts linked below!

 *__C3G Technology Development Team__* - Montreal, QC   
July 2017 - current    
Software Developer & Data Analyst 

I am part of the technology development team at McGill University's C3G. We are an academic research entity that focuses on writing open source tools for the genomics community, providing data analysis support for academics and training researchers to run bioinformatics analyses.

My role involves several tasks at C3G, under three broad categories:

** Technology Development:

- Involved in the development and maintenance of GenPipes, an open source python framework facilitating multi-step analyses on HPC clusters.
- In addition to code contribution to GenPipes, I am heavily involved in documenting GenPipes, creating test datasets for users, user support and user training.
- Set up GenPipes automated testing through Jenkins. Integrated Jenkins with slack, email, and bitbucket.
- Set up scheduled system monitoring of resources across 5 different HPC servers.
- Managing GenPipes data analysis reporting system through interactive plots and customized reports through MultiQc.
- Contributed to several open source tools (HiCUP, MultiQC) to adapt them based on C3G needs.


** Data Analysis:

- Involved in several large scale data analysis projects that are aimed at understanding human health and disease. Tasks include data quality control, data parsing/cleaning, script/code development, statistical analysis, data visualization and data reporting/presentation.

** Organization logistics:

- involved in C3G grant/manuscript writing and annual performance reporting on computing resources.
- Organization administrator for Google Summer of Code (2018, 2019).
- Organization administrator and mentor for Google Season of Docs (2019).
- Lead and managed bioinformatics workshops with a team of 4-5 people. Handled all logistics, including creating/curating tutorial material, room booking, scheduling, user registration, refunds, catering, feedback collection...
