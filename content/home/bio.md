I am a Research Scientist, Software Developer and Data Analyst at McGill University's C3G, probing questions related to human health by building and using bioinformatics tools.  

I am an organized modular thinker who breaks problems into their individual, manageable building blocks. I am also an efficient problem solver, with an eye for detail.
