<span style="font-size:larger; color:#0095eb">**Computer Science:**</span>   

I spent 4 years of my PhD in the Computer Science Department at McGill University. I also took several computer science courses at McGill. I use a wide array of programming languages, depending on the task, but focus mainly on python and R for their efficacy with data analysis tasks.
