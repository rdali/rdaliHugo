I have a wide variety of skills, resulting from my very diverse background from research science to development. I think of myself as a knowledge nomad of sorts.

My field of expertise is primarily ***DATA***. I have worked in data related fields for as long as I can remember. I started in data entry at 16 years old and have since been moving through the data ecosystem to understand the full data lifecycle.

**Skills to mentions:** Data Quality/profiling and standardization, Data Analytics & BI, Machine Learning Skills, Data visualization, Specialized data types (Bioinformatics, Geospatial)...

***Development***: How do you do anything useful with data consistently and at scale? programming! I got into software developement almost a decade ago when I realized that I could not do much with my terrabytes of data if I do not have the proper tooling.

**Skills to mentions:** Programming (Python, R, Bash, Java...), CI/CD(Jenkins, CircleCI), High Performance Computing, Docker, Orchestration...

***The Cloud:*** Where do you store and manipulate data flexibly? the cloud is a great and affordable offering that allows anyone to build systems with a low entry barrier.

**Skills to mentions:** AWS enthusiast with 10 AWS certifications: Practitioner, Architect, Developer, SysOps, Architect Pro, DevOPs, Machine Learning, Analytics, Security, Databases.
