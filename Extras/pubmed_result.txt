Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly malignant brain cancer of glial 
cell origin, with a median patient survival of less than 20 months. Transcription
factors FOXG1 and TLE1 promote GBM propagation by supporting maintenance of brain
tumour-initiating cells (BTICs) with stem-like properties. Here, we characterize 
FOXG1 and TLE1 target genes in GBM patient-derived BTICs using ChIP-Seq and
RNA-Seq approaches. These studies identify 150 direct FOXG1 targets, several of
which are also TLE1 targets, involved in cell proliferation, differentiation,
survival, chemotaxis and angiogenesis. Negative regulators of NOTCH signalling,
including CHAC1, are among the transcriptional repression targets of FOXG1:TLE1
complexes, suggesting a crosstalk between FOXG1:TLE1 and NOTCH-mediated pathways 
in GBM. These results provide previously unavailable insight into the
transcriptional programs underlying the tumour-promoting functions of FOXG1:TLE1 
in GBM.

University, Montreal, Canada.

Topologically associating domains (TADs) have been proposed to be the basic unit 
of chromosome folding and have been shown to play key roles in genome
organization and gene regulation. Several different tools are available for TAD
prediction, but their properties have never been thoroughly assessed. In this
manuscript, we compare the output of seven different TAD prediction tools on two 
published Hi-C data sets. TAD predictions varied greatly between tools in number,
size distribution and other biological properties. Assessed against a manual
annotation of TADs, individual TAD boundary predictions were found to be quite
reliable, but their assembly into complete TAD structures was much less so. In
addition, many tools were sensitive to sequencing depth and resolution of the
interaction frequency matrix. This manuscript provides users and designers of TAD
prediction tools with information that will help guide the choice of tools and
the interpretation of their predictions.

Somatic motor neurons in the hypoglossal nucleus innervate tongue muscles
controlling vital functions such as chewing, swallowing and respiration.
Formation of functional hypoglossal nerve circuits depends on the establishment
of precise hypoglossal motor neuron maps correlating with specific tongue muscle 
innervations. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling
mammalian hypoglossal motor neuron topographic map formation. Here we show that
combinatorial expression of transcription factors Runx1, SCIP and FoxP1 defines
separate mouse hypoglossal motor neuron groups with different topological,
neurotransmitter and calcium-buffering phenotypes. Runx1 and SCIP are coexpressed
in ventromedial hypoglossal motor neurons involved in control of tongue
protrusion whereas FoxP1 is expressed in dorsomedial motor neurons associated
with tongue retraction. Establishment of separate hypoglossal motor neuron maps
depends in part on Runx1-mediated suppression of ventrolateral and dorsomedial
motor neuron phenotypes and regulation of FoxP1 expression pattern. These
findings suggest that combinatorial actions of Runx1, SCIP and FoxP1 are
important for mouse hypoglossal nucleus somatotopic map formation.

The G1 cyclins play a pivotal role in regulation of cell differentiation and
proliferation. The mechanisms underlying their cell-specific roles are
incompletely understood. Here, we show that a G1 cyclin, cyclin D2 (CycD2),
enhances the activity of transcription factor GATA4, a key regulator of
cardiomyocyte growth and differentiation. GATA4 recruits CycD2 to its target
promoters, and their interaction results in synergistic activation of
GATA-dependent transcription. This effect is specific to CycD2 because CycD1 is
unable to potentiate activity of GATA4 and is CDK-independent. GATA4 physically
interacts with CycD2 through a discreet N-terminal activation domain that is
essential for the cardiogenic activity of GATA4. Human mutations in this domain
that are linked to congenital heart disease interfere with CycD2-GATA4 synergy.
Cardiogenesis assays in Xenopus embryos indicate that CycD2 enhances the
cardiogenic function of GATA4. Together, our data uncover a role for CycD2 as a
cardiogenic coactivator of GATA4 and suggest a paradigm for cell-specific effects
of cyclin Ds.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly malignant brain cancer, with a
median survival of <2 years. GBM displays a cellular complexity that includes
brain tumour-initiating cells (BTICs), which are considered as potential key
targets for GBM therapies. Here we show that the transcription factors FOXG1 and 
Groucho/TLE are expressed in poorly differentiated astroglial cells in human GBM 
specimens and in primary cultures of GBM-derived BTICs, where they form a
complex. FOXG1 knockdown in BTICs causes downregulation of neural stem/progenitor
and proliferation markers, increased replicative senescence, upregulation of
astroglial differentiation genes and decreased BTIC-initiated tumour growth after
intracranial transplantation into host mice. These effects are phenocopied by
Groucho/TLE knockdown or dominant inhibition of the FOXG1:Groucho/TLE complex.
These results provide evidence that transcriptional programmes regulated by FOXG1
and Groucho/TLE are important for BTIC-initiated brain tumour growth, implicating
FOXG1 and Groucho/TLE in GBM tumourigenesis.

The Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split 1 (Gro/TLE1):Hes1 transcriptional
repression complex acts in cerebral cortical neural progenitor cells to inhibit
neuronal differentiation. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the
anti-neurogenic function of the Gro/TLE1:Hes1 complex during cortical
neurogenesis remain to be defined. Here we show that prolyl isomerase Pin1
(peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1) and
homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) are expressed in cortical neural
progenitor cells and form a complex that interacts with the Gro/TLE1:Hes1
complex. This association depends on the enzymatic activities of both HIPK2 and
Pin1, as well as on the association of Gro/TLE1 with Hes1, but is independent of 
the previously described Hes1-activated phosphorylation of Gro/TLE1. Interaction 
with the Pin1:HIPK2 complex results in Gro/TLE1 hyperphosphorylation and weakens 
both the transcriptional repression activity and the anti-neurogenic function of 
the Gro/TLE1:Hes1 complex. These results provide evidence that HIPK2 and Pin1
work together to promote cortical neurogenesis, at least in part, by suppressing 
Gro/TLE1:Hes1-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation.

The potential for evolutionary change is limited by the availability of genetic
variation. Mutations are the ultimate source of new alleles, yet there have been 
few experimental investigations of the role of novel mutations in multivariate
phenotypic evolution. Here, we evaluated the degree of multivariate phenotypic
divergence observed in a long-term evolution experiment whereby replicate
lineages of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans were derived from a
single genotype and allowed to fix novel (beneficial) mutations while maintained 
at two different population sizes. We asked three fundamental questions regarding
phenotypic divergence following approximately 800 generations of adaptation: (1) 
whether divergence was limited by mutational supply, (2) whether divergence
proceeded in relatively many (few) multivariate directions, and (3) to what
degree phenotypic divergence scaled with changes in fitness (i.e. adaptation). We
found no evidence that mutational supply limited phenotypic divergence.
Divergence also occurred in all possible phenotypic directions, implying that
pleiotropy was either weak or sufficiently variable among new mutations so as not
to constrain the direction of multivariate evolution. The degree of total
phenotypic divergence from the common ancestor was positively correlated with the
extent of adaptation. These results are discussed in the context of the evolution
of complex phenotypes through the input of adaptive mutations.

Antagonistic interactions peak at intermediate genetic distance in clinical and
laboratory strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

BACKGROUND: Bacteria excrete costly toxins to defend their ecological niche. The 
evolution of such antagonistic interactions between individuals is expected to
depend on both the social environment and the strength of resource competition.
Antagonism is expected to be weak among highly similar genotypes because most
individuals are immune to antagonistic agents and among dissimilar genotypes
because these are unlikely to be competing for the same resources and antagonism 
should not yield much benefit. The strength of antagonism is therefore expected
to peak at intermediate genetic distance.
RESULTS: We studied the ability of laboratory strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
to prevent growth of 55 different clinical P. aeruginosa isolates derived from
cystic fibrosis patients. Genetic distance was determined using genetic
fingerprints. We found that the strength of antagonism was maximal among
genotypes of intermediate genetic distance and we show that genetic distance and 
resource use are linked.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the importance of social interactions like 
antagonism may be modulated by the strength of resource competition.

    Curr Biol. 2010 Aug 10;20(15):R637-9.

Sex is a long-standing evolutionary enigma. Although the majority of eukaryotes
reproduce sexually at least sometimes [1-3], the evolution of sex from an asexual
ancestor has been difficult to explain because it requires sexually reproducing
lineages to overcome the manifold costs of sex, including the destruction of
favorable gene combinations created by selection [4, 5]. Conditions for the
evolution of sex are much broader if individuals can reproduce either sexually or
asexually (i.e., facultative sex) and allocate disproportionately more resources 
to sex when their fitness is low (fitness-associated-sex or FAS [6-10]). Although
facultatively sexual organisms have been shown to engage in more sex when
stressed [11], direct evidence for FAS is lacking. We provide evidence using 53
genotypes of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans in a reciprocal
transplant experiment across three environments. Different genotypes achieved
highest fitness in different environments and genotypes invested relatively more 
in sex in environments in which their fitness was lower, showing that allocation 
to sexual reproduction is a function of how well-adapted a genotype is to its
environment. FAS in A. nidulans is unlikely to have evolved as a strategy to
resist or avoid stress because asexual spores are more dispersive and equally
resistant [12, 13].
